## Project 1: Android App Metrics Analysis (2010-2018 Data)

**Summary**: This project analyzes over 10,000 Android apps to understand the factors driving app success in a highly competitive environment. By leveraging data from the Google Play Store (2010-2018) and focusing on genre, audience, and seasonality, the analysis introduces a unique "Deviation Metric" model that provides actionable insights for app developers.

**Key Insights**:
- Improved data quality by 75% by cleaning and processing data in R, removing duplicates, and imputing missing values.
- Developed a 'Deviation Metric' model in Power BI to evaluate app performance against key variables, revealing:
  - A **250% rise** in arcade game downloads supporting the stress-relief theory.
  - A **450% surge** in communication app downloads, emphasizing the importance of human interaction.
  - A **310% spike** in app downloads during summer, suggesting optimal release timing.
  - A **200% higher download rate** among pre-teens and teens, guiding targeted marketing and app design.

### Key Elements:

1. **Why Focus on Genre Instead of Category?**
   - Unlike traditional studies that focus on category, this analysis introduces a novel approach by emphasizing genre for greater accuracy. Categories like 'Family' or 'Game' contain various genres, making genre a more precise factor for evaluating app success.

   *"This project focuses on analyzing app success by genre rather than category to provide more accurate insights. Categories like 'Family' and 'Game' include various genres, which can be better evaluated individually."*

2. **Deviation Metric by Genre**
   - The Deviation Metric by Genre reveals the variations in app downloads by genre, indicating which types of apps outperform or underperform. For instance:
     - A **450% rise** in downloads for communication apps, highlighting user preference for value-centric apps.
     - A **250% rise** in downloads for arcade games, supporting the stress-relief theory.

   *"The Deviation Metric by Genre reveals that communication and arcade genres have the highest deviations in app downloads, suggesting these genres are more likely to drive success. Understanding these trends, such as user preference for value-centric apps, helps in making strategic decisions for app development and marketing."*

3. **Deviation Metric by Audience Target**
   - This analysis identifies pre-teens and teens as the most significant audience segment, with a **200% higher download rate** compared to other demographics, guiding targeted marketing and app design strategies.

   *"The Deviation Metric by Audience Target highlights pre-teens and teens as the dominant audience for app downloads, emphasizing the importance of tailoring marketing and design strategies to appeal to these groups."*

## Project 2: SF Bike Share Insights (2017-2019 Data)

**Summary**: This project analyzes bike share data from San Francisco, focusing on identifying key user trends and uncovering opportunities to enhance customer lifetime value (CLV) through targeted conversions and retention strategies. The analysis utilizes Tableau for visualization to provide actionable insights into user behavior, customer segments, and promotional strategies.

**Key Insights**:
- Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard interpreting **1M+ rows** of data, revealing key user trends and informing data-driven decision-making.
- Identified opportunities for CLV enhancement by detecting that **18%** of users (casual riders) use bikes **3.5x longer** than subscribers, highlighting potential conversion strategies.
- Estimated a **2.73%** revenue growth by modeling a **20%** conversion of high-value casual riders to subscribers, suggesting retention strategies like perk boosts.
- Revealed that **50%** of casual users are gender-unspecified, driving **45%** of trip durations, suggesting tailored engagement strategies.
- Identified that **100%** of gender-unspecified users were born in 1985, contributing to **10%** of all trips, prompting targeted promotional initiatives.

## Project 3: Analyzing COVID-19 Trends (2020-2021 Data)

**Summary**: This project involves analyzing COVID-19 trends using data from 2020-2021. The analysis focuses on extracting insights related to case trends, mortality rates, and vaccination progress during the pandemic period.

**Key Insights**:
- Conducted comprehensive data analysis using SQL to extract meaningful insights from **85k+ records**, covering case trends, mortality rates, and vaccination progress.
- Developed mortality risk models to correlate cases and deaths, revealing Lebanon's peak death rate of **4.92%**.
- Normalized death rates per capita, identifying Hungary as having the highest mortality rate of **0.28%**.
- Determined high-risk regions based on infection rates per capita, with Andorra (**17.12%**) and Montenegro (**15.5%**) being the most impacted.
- Assessed vaccination progress, showing that the U.S. vaccinated over **68%** of its population with at least one dose by the analysis end date.
