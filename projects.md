## Project 1: Android App Metrics Analysis (2010-2018 Data)

**Summary**: This project analyzes over 10,000 Android apps to understand the factors driving app success in a highly competitive environment. By leveraging data from the Google Play Store (2010-2018) and focusing on genre, audience, and seasonality, the analysis introduces a unique "Deviation Metric" model that provides actionable insights for app developers.

**Key Insights**:
- Improved data quality by 75% by cleaning and processing data in R, removing duplicates, and imputing missing values.
- Developed a 'Deviation Metric' model in Power BI to evaluate app performance against key variables, revealing:
  - A **250% rise** in arcade game downloads supporting the stress-relief theory.
  - A **450% surge** in communication app downloads, emphasizing the importance of human interaction.
  - A **310% spike** in app downloads during summer, suggesting optimal release timing.
