## Project 1: Android App Metrics Analysis (2010-2018 Data)

**Summary**: This project analyzes over 10,000 Android apps to understand the factors driving app success in a highly competitive environment. By leveraging data from the Google Play Store (2010-2018) and focusing on genre, audience, and seasonality, the analysis introduces a unique "Deviation Metric" model that provides actionable insights for app developers.

**Key Insights**:
- Improved data quality by 75% by cleaning and processing data in R, removing duplicates, and imputing missing values.
- Developed a 'Deviation Metric' model in Power BI to evaluate app performance against key variables, revealing:
  - A **250% rise** in arcade game downloads supporting the stress-relief theory.
  - A **450% surge** in communication app downloads, emphasizing the importance of human interaction.
  - A **310% spike** in app downloads during summer, suggesting optimal release timing.
  - A **200% higher download rate** among pre-teens and teens, guiding targeted marketing and app design.

## Project 3: Analyzing COVID-19 Trends (2020-2021 Data)

**Summary**: This project involves analyzing COVID-19 trends using data from 2020-2021. The analysis focuses on extracting insights related to case trends, mortality rates, and vaccination progress during the pandemic period.

**Key Insights**:
- Conducted comprehensive data analysis using SQL to extract meaningful insights from **85k+ records**, covering case trends, mortality rates, and vaccination progress.
- Developed mortality risk models to correlate cases and deaths, revealing Lebanon's peak death rate of **4.92%**.
- Normalized death rates per capita, identifying Hungary as having the highest mortality rate of **0.28%**.
- Determined high-risk regions based on infection rates per capita, with Andorra (**17.12%**) and Montenegro (**15.5%**) being the most impacted.
- Assessed vaccination progress, showing that the U.S. vaccinated over **68%** of its population with at least one dose by the analysis end date.
