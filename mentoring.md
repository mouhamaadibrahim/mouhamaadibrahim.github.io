- **Boosted student engagement by 30%** with real-world SQL exercises in Management Information Systems, achieving a 90%+ pass rate.
- **Propelled 45% of students scoring 85%+ in Probability & Statistics** by integrating data analysis methodologies, leading to an 89% pass rate.
- **Facilitated 70%+ achievement among 50% of students** in data science-related courses like Linear Algebra and Discrete Math, supporting algorithm development and problem-solving, with over 5 students securing programming jobs.
- **Achieved 50% of students earning 80%+ in Calculus III** by incorporating various analytical techniques, including data modeling like least squares regression, resulting in a 94% pass rate.
- **Attained 40% of students scoring 75%+ in Calculus & Applied Math for Business** by incorporating real-world statistical analysis problems, contributing to an 85% pass rate.

## Impact of Teaching and Mentorship

My mentorship has significantly impacted students' academic journeys, empowering them to excel in data-related courses and secure opportunities in their careers. By integrating practical exercises and real-world data analysis scenarios, I have enhanced students’ problem-solving and technical skills, preparing them for industry demands.

### Student Testimonial
> *“I had the great fortune of being taught by Dr. Mouhamad Ibrahim at AUT in courses like Probability and Statistics, Discrete Math, and Calculus III. He has a talent for turning complex topics, like regression and minimizing RSS, into clear, practical lessons that stick with you. Dr. Ibrahim’s passion for data and his supportive, engaging teaching style made a huge impact on my learning. He truly cares about his students and inspires a love for analytics. I highly recommend him for any data analyst role—his expertise and enthusiasm would be a great asset to any team.”*

## Detailed Examples of Student Projects

Below are detailed examples of student projects that were part of the "Business Statistics" course. These projects illustrate how students applied statistical concepts to real-world business challenges through hands-on projects.

### 1. Analysis of Global Travel Patterns, Preferences, and Costs

- **Project Overview:** This project provides an in-depth analysis of global travel patterns, preferences, and costs using a comprehensive travel dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset includes detailed information on trips, such as destinations, travel dates, trip durations, traveler demographics, and the type and cost of accommodation and transportation. The objective is to gain insights into travel behaviors and preferences, which can help travel-related businesses tailor their marketing strategies and travel packages.
