*Description*: The figure illustrates the analytical optimization of the dimensional parameters for planar interdigitated electrodes, focusing on the optimal **S/W ratio of 0.66**. This geometrical term is crucial for enhancing the performance of bioimpedance sensors, resulting in better accuracy, a wider analysis band, and increased sensor sensitivity by **18%**.

### Calculation of the 65% Improvement in Analysis Effectiveness

To demonstrate the improvement in analysis effectiveness, a comparative analysis was conducted between optimized and non-optimized sensor configurations.

| Sensor Type                   | Cutoff Frequency (F(Low)) | Analysis Band (Hz) | Percentage Improvement |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| Optimized Sensor (S/W = 0.66) | 1.2 × 10⁵ Hz              | 9.88 × 10⁶ Hz      | 65%                    |
| Non-Optimized Sensor (S/W = 4)| 40 × 10⁵ Hz               | 6 × 10⁶ Hz         | -                      |

*Description*: The table above compares the optimized and non-optimized sensor designs. The optimized sensor (**S/W = 0.66**) shows a significant **65% improvement** in the analysis band, which translates to enhanced sensor performance in bioimpedance spectroscopy and has led to adoption by multiple industry leaders.
