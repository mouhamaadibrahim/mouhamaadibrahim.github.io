*Description*: The figure illustrates the analytical optimization of the dimensional parameters for planar interdigitated electrodes, focusing on the optimal S/W ratio of 0.66. This geometrical term is crucial for enhancing the performance of bioimpedance sensors, resulting in better accuracy and a wider analysis band.

### Calculation of the 65% Improvement in Analysis Effectiveness

To demonstrate the improvement in analysis effectiveness, a comparative analysis was conducted between optimized and non-optimized sensor configurations.

| Sensor Type              | Cutoff Frequency (F(Low)) | Analysis Band (Hz) | Percentage Improvement |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| Optimized Sensor (S/W = 0.66) | 1.2 × 10⁵ Hz         | 9.88 × 10⁶ Hz     | -                       |
| Non-Optimized Sensor (S/W = 4)| 40 × 10⁵ Hz          | 6 × 10⁶ Hz        | 65%                     |

*Description*: The table above compares the optimized and non-optimized sensor designs. The optimized sensor (S/W = 0.66) shows a significant 65% improvement in the analysis band, which translates to enhanced sensor performance in bioimpedance spectroscopy.
